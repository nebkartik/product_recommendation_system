Transformer Variants for Productions

1. EfficientFormer
   - A lightweight transformer designed for efficiency in edge devices and mobile deployments. 
   - Balances accuracy with reduced computational cost, making it suitable for production environments with limited resources.

2. Longformer
   - Optimized for handling very long sequences using sparse attention mechanisms. 
   - Useful in document-level NLP tasks like summarization and question answering over long texts.

3. Performer
   - Introduces linear attention via kernel methods to reduce memory and computation. 
   - Enables scaling transformers to very large contexts while remaining efficient.

4. Linformer
   - Projects the attention matrix into a lower-dimensional space. 
   - Reduces complexity from quadratic to linear, making it practical for production workloads.

5. Reformer
   - Uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and reversible layers to cut down memory usage. 
   - Ideal for training large models on limited hardware.

6. BigBird
   - Combines random, global, and sliding window attention patterns. 
   - Handles sequences up to thousands of tokens, enabling tasks like long document classification.

7. Funnel Transformer
   - Compresses sequence length progressively while deepening representation. 
   - Improves efficiency and speed, especially for classification tasks.

8. Switch Transformer
   - A mixture-of-experts model where only a subset of parameters are activated per input. 
   - Achieves massive scale with reduced compute per example.

9. Transformer-XL
   - Adds recurrence to the transformer architecture. 
   - Extends context length beyond fixed windows, useful for language modeling and sequential tasks.

10. GPT-style Transformers
    - Autoregressive transformers trained for text generation. 
    - Widely used in production for chatbots, content creation, and reasoning tasks.
